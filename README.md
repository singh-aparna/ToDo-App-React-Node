# To-Do App built using the MERN stack! ðŸŒŸ

## **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: React (with Axios for API calls)
- **Backend**: Node.js & Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB & MongoDB Atlas for cloud storage

## **Key Features**
âœ… Add a new task  
âœ… Select or marked an existing completed task  
âœ… Delete tasks youâ€™ve completed or no longer need  

This project helped me dive deeper into full-stack development and understand the power of seamless integration between frontend and backend technologies.

## **What I Learned**
- Building RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express  
- Connecting to a cloud database using MongoDB Atlas  
- Managing state and making HTTP requests using React and Axios  
- Deploying and testing a full-stack application
