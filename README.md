# To-Do App built using the MERN stack! ðŸŒŸ

ðŸ›   ## **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: React (with Axios for API calls)
- **Backend**: Node.js & Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB & MongoDB Atlas for cloud storage

## **Key Features**
âœ… Add a new task  
âœ… Select or marked an existing completed task  
âœ… Delete tasks youâ€™ve completed or no longer need  

This project helped me dive deeper into full-stack development and understand the power of seamless integration between frontend and backend technologies.

## **What I Learned**
-  Building RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express    
-  Connecting to a cloud database using MongoDB Atlas    
-  Managing state and making HTTP requests using React and Axios    
-  Deploying and testing a full-stack application  

## **Updates**
âœ… Users can now register, log in & log out, and securely interact with tasks.   
âœ… However, currently, users can view and manage tasks added by all users, not just their own.   

## **Upcoming updates**
âœ… Users will be able to view and manage only their personal tasksâ€”making the app even more tailored and secure for each individual user.  

## **What I Learned**
âœ… JWT Authentication: Secure user login and token management.  
âœ… Cookies: Storing and sending authentication tokens securely.  
âœ… CORS Errors: Resolved cross-origin issues to ensure smooth API calls between frontend and backend.  
âœ… Backend Security: Added robust error handling and improved session management.  
âœ… Express & MongoDB: Leveraged Express for server management and MongoDB for efficient data storage.  
âœ… bcrypt: Implemented password hashing using bcrypt for securely storing passwords. Learned how to generate salts and hash passwords to protect user credentials from being compromised.

## **Key Takeaways**

â†’  Understanding JWT for authentication is crucial for building secure apps.  
â†’  Handling cookies properly can make a huge difference in user session management.  
â†’  Dealing with CORS errors is a necessary skill for handling frontend-backend communication in modern web apps.  
â†’  Password security is a must! bcrypt has been an essential tool for safely storing passwords.
